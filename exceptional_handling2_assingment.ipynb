    "# Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In Python, the `Exception` class is the base class for all built-in exceptions. When creating a custom exception, inheriting from the `Exception` class ensures that your custom exception integrates properly with Python's exception handling framework. It allows your custom exception to behave like standard exceptions and ensures consistency in how exceptions are raised, caught, and handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `Exception` class as the base class, you:\n",
    "- Ensure your custom exception is a subclass of `Exception`, making it compatible with existing exception handling constructs.\n",
    "- Benefit from the built-in methods and attributes of the `Exception` class, such as the ability to provide an error message.\n",
    "- Maintain a clear hierarchy of exceptions, which aids in debugging and code readability.\n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. Catch Specific Exceptions: Handle specific exceptions instead of a general `Exception` to avoid masking other bugs.\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError) as e:\n",
    "        # handle specific exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `finally` for Cleanup: Ensure resources are released properly using the `finally` block.\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open('file.txt', 'r')\n",
    "        # process file\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid Bare `except` Clauses: Avoid using bare `except:` clauses as they catch all exceptions including system exits and interrupts.\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # handle exception\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log Exceptions: Use logging to record exceptions for later analysis.\n",

    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        logging.error(\"Exception occurred\", exc_info=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reraise Exceptions: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it, re-raise it to let higher levels handle it.\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # handle or log\n",
