    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "MongoDB is a NoSQL, open-source database that uses a document-oriented data model. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for flexible and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and are typically schema-less. They provide high scalability and flexibility compared to traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "1. The data structure is dynamic or evolving.\n",
    "2. High write loads and horizontal scaling are required.\n",
    "3. Real-time analytics or rapid development is needed.\n",
    "4. The application demands flexible querying and indexing.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: Stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, which allows for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "2. Schema Flexibility: No fixed schema, allowing for dynamic data structures.\n",
    "3. Horizontal Scalability: Supports sharding to distribute data across multiple servers for load balancing and increased capacity.\n",
    "4. Indexing: Supports various indexing strategies to optimize query performance.\n",
    "5. Aggregation Framework: Provides powerful data aggregation and transformation capabilities.\n",
    "6. High Availability: Features replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "7. Rich Query Language: Supports complex queries and joins using the aggregation pipeline.\n",
    "8. Easy Deployment: Can be easily deployed on-premises or in the cloud.\n",

    "# Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(record)\n",

    "# Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The `find()` method is used to query MongoDB collections. It retrieves documents that match a specified query. You can pass query criteria to `find()` to filter the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example code:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}  # Find documents where age is greater than 30\n",

    "# Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The `sort()` method is used to sort the results of a query. You can specify the fields and the sort order (ascending or descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example code:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in ascending order\n",
    "sorted_results = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sorted Results by Age (Ascending):\")\n",
    "for result in sorted_results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "sorted_results_desc = collection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nSorted Results by Age (Descending):\")\n",
    "for result in sorted_results_desc:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. `delete_one(filter)`: Removes a single document that matches the specified filter criteria. Useful when you want to delete a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `delete_many(filter)`: Removes multiple documents that match the specified filter criteria. Useful when you want to delete multiple documents at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `drop()`: Deletes the entire collection from the database. Useful when you want to remove all documents and metadata associated with the collection.\n",
