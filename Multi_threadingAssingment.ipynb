    "# Q1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a technique that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread represents a separate path of execution, and threads share the same memory space but run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to:\n",
    "- Improve application performance by executing tasks in parallel.\n",
    "- Perform I/O-bound operations efficiently, such as reading/writing files or network operations.\n",
    "- Utilize multi-core processors to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is the `threading` module.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Why is the threading module used? Write the use of the following functions (activeCount, currentThread, enumerate).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The `threading` module is used to create, manage, and synchronize threads in Python. It provides the necessary tools to work with threads, including functions for creating and managing thread instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `activeCount()`: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "- `currentThread()`: Returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller's thread.\n",
    "- `enumerate()`: Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Explain the following functions (run, start, join, isAlive).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- `run()`: This method represents the entry point for the thread. It is overridden in a subclass of `Thread` to define the thread's behavior. By default, it does nothing.\n",
    "- `start()`: Starts a thread's activity. This method must be called to initiate the thread's execution. It invokes the `run()` method.\n",
    "- `join()`: Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates. It is used to wait for thread completion.\n",
    "- `isAlive()`: Returns `True` if the thread is still alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet finished execution). Returns `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares and thread two must print the list of cubes.\n",

    "    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "    print(\"Squares:\", squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    cubes = [x**3 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "    print(\"Cubes:\", cubes)\n",

    "# Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Improved performance and responsiveness in applications.\n",
    "- Efficient use of CPU resources, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "- Better user experience by allowing background operations without freezing the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Increased complexity in code management and debugging.\n",
    "- Potential for race conditions and deadlocks if threads are not properly synchronized.\n",
    "- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python can limit the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Deadlocks: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on the other to release resources. This situation arises when threads acquire locks in different orders, causing a circular wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Thread 1 holds Lock A and waits for Lock B.\n",
    "Thread 2 holds Lock B and waits for Lock A.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Race Conditions: A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events such as thread execution. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or corrupted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Thread 1 and Thread 2 both try to update a shared variable without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent results.\n",
