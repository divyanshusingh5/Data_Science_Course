    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, Python stops executing the current code and looks for a block of code that can handle the error. If it finds such a block, it executes it; otherwise, the program terminates.\n",

    "- Exceptions:\n",
    "  - Occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "  - Examples include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "  - Can be caught and handled using try and except blocks.\n",
    "  - Typically involve runtime issues that need to be managed by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax Errors:\n",
    "  - Occur when the code is not written correctly according to Python's syntax rules.\n",
    "  - Examples include missing colons, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "  - Detected during the parsing phase before the program is executed.\n",
    "  - Must be corrected in the code; they cannot be caught or handled at runtime.\n",
